# Scala 3 + ZIO 2.x Agent Instructions**

This file defines how agent should behave when working on **Scala 3** + **ZIO 2.x** projects.

Agent must treat these rules as **global guidance** for code generation, refactoring, architecture, documentation, and testing.

---

# 1. Purpose

Agent acts as a highly specialized Scala 3 + ZIO engineer with expertise in:

* Effect-Oriented Programming
* Functional architectures
* Type-safe domain modeling
* Resource-safe systems
* Concurrency and parallelism
* Typed error handling
* ZLayer dependency injection
* ZIO Test

Agent’s job is to produce:
**correct, idiomatic, maintainable, composable, resource-safe ZIO code.**

---

# 2. Core Principles (Mandatory)

## 2.1 Effects Are Immutable Descriptions

* A ZIO value is **not** running code — it is a pure description.
* Side effects must be wrapped with:

  * `ZIO.attempt`
  * `ZIO.attemptBlocking`
  * `ZIO.suspend`
  * `ZIO.async`
  * `ZIO.fromFuture`
* No side effects inside pure values or constructors.
* No `println` in business logic; use `ZIO.log*`.

## 2.2 Typed Error Channels

* All errors MUST be typed using domain-specific ADTs.
* No thrown exceptions.
* No untyped `Throwable` in business logic.
* Error handling must be **exhaustive** and **explicit**.
* Avoid `catchAll(_ => ...)` unless explicitly justified.

## 2.3 Resource Safety

* Manage resources with:

  * `ZIO.acquireRelease`
  * `ZIO.acquireReleaseInterruptible`
  * `Scope`
  * `ZLayer.scoped`
* Finalizers must always run (normal, error, interruption).

## 2.4 Functional Architecture

* Domain logic is pure and deterministic.
* I/O lives at the edges.
* Use ZLayer for dependency injection and wiring.
* **No `var`**, no shared mutable state.
* Use `Ref`, `Queue`, `Hub`, etc. for concurrency.
* Respect the three laws of the ZIO environment: accumulate requirements, allow weakening (sub-environments), and satisfy by providing dependencies once at the edge.

# 3. Code Construction Rules

## 3.1 Build & Run
The project uses `sbt` for all tasks.
- **Compile:** `sbt compile`
- **Format Code:** `sbt fmt` (Run this before submitting any changes)
- **Build Fat JAR:** `sbt assembly`

## 3.2 Testing Protocols
You MUST verify your changes by running tests.
- **Run Unit Tests:** `sbt test`
  - *Note:* These use `ZIO Test` and `scalamock-zio`. They do not require external secrets.
- **Run Integration Tests:** `sbt it:test`
- **Run Benchmarks:** `sbt bench:test`

## 3.3 Allowed Effect Constructors

Use only the following for effect creation:

```
ZIO.succeed
ZIO.fail
ZIO.attempt
ZIO.attemptBlocking
ZIO.async
ZIO.fromFuture
ZIO.suspend
```

Forbidden:

* side effects inside `ZIO.succeed`
* constructors doing real work

## 3.4 Composition Patterns

Canonical patterns:

```
for {
  a <- effectA
  b <- effectB(a)
  _ <- log(b)
} yield b
```

Use:

* `*>` and `<*`
* `>>=` and `zip`
* `zipPar`
* `race`
* `ZIO.foreachPar`
* `.withParallelism(n)`

Avoid:

* nested flatMaps
* combinator soup when a `for` is clearer

---

# 4. Error Handling

## 4.1 Typed, Explicit, Exhaustive

* Use ADTs: `enum`, `case object`, `case class`.
* Do not hide errors.
* Do not swallow exceptions.
* Prefer sealed ADTs or union types for small, explicit error sets; keep an `Unexpected` case for defect mapping at the edge.
* Map throwables exactly once at the boundary; do not leak `Throwable` through business APIs.
* Keep domain ADTs per subsystem (e.g., `SigningError`, `LiquidityError`, `RelayerMetricsError`) and map them into higher-level wiring errors at the boundary when composing layers.

Example:

```scala
effect.catchAll {
  case e: DomainError => recover(e)
}
```

## 4.2 Recommended Patterns

* Retries with `Schedule` (exponential backoff)
* Fallbacks with `orElse`
* Timeouts with `timeout` or `timeoutFail`
* Request hedging with `race`
* Circuit breakers (Rezilience)

---

# 5. Dependency Injection with ZLayer

## 5.1 Service Definition Pattern

Example:

```scala
trait UserRepo:
  def find(id: UserId): IO[RepoError, User]

final case class UserRepoLive(pool: ConnectionPool) extends UserRepo:
  def find(id: UserId) = ???

object UserRepo:
  val live: ZLayer[ConnectionPool, Nothing, UserRepo] =
    ZLayer.fromFunction(UserRepoLive.apply)
```

## 5.2 Rules

* No layer creation inside effect bodies.
* Use `ZIO.serviceWithZIO` for service access.
* Compose dependency graphs at the application boundary.
* Define services as pure algebras (traits) without side-effectful constructors; keep implementations in `*Live` classes.
* Prefer polymorphic services (type params on effect types) when this improves testing or reuse.
* Honor the environment laws: accumulate requirements, allow narrowing, and satisfy dependencies once at the edge.
* Use accessor helpers on the companion (`def doThing(...) = ZIO.serviceWithZIO[Svc](_.doThing(...))`) to avoid ad-hoc service lookups.

### DI / Wiring Checklist

* Typed error channels only (no raw `Throwable`); map to domain ADTs at the boundary.
* Background work must be scoped (`forkScoped`, `acquireRelease`) so fibers are cleaned up.
* No side effects in constructors; push real work into ZIO effects and layers.
* Avoid recomputing layers per call; define at module boundaries and inject.
* Map edge-service errors (Liquidity/Relayer/Signing) into wiring-level errors where layers are composed.
* Scope all servers/loops/metrics updaters with `ZLayer.scoped` or `forkScoped`; never leave daemon fibers untracked.

---

# 6. Concurrency & Parallelism

Use:

* `zipPar`
* `race`
* `foreachPar`
* `.withParallelism(n)`

Avoid:

* Unbounded fiber creation
* Blocking outside of `attemptBlocking`
* Shared mutable vars

Good example:

```scala
ZIO.foreachPar(items)(process).withParallelism(16)
```

Concurrency guidelines:

* Prefer structured concurrency; bind child fibers to scopes with `forkScoped` or managed resources.
* Move blocking I/O to `attemptBlocking`/`attemptBlockingInterrupt`; avoid `Thread.sleep` or busy-waiting.
* Use coordination primitives (`Queue`, `Hub`, `Semaphore`, `RateLimiter`) instead of manual locks.
* Cancel or supervise long-lived fibers; add finalizers for cleanup on interruption.

---

# 7. Testing Standards

Use ZIO Test:

* `ZIOSpecDefault`
* `TestClock`
* `TestRandom`
* `TestConsole`
* `TestEnvironment`

Tests must cover:

* Success cases
* Failure cases
* Boundary conditions
* Resource cleanup
* Time-based and concurrency behavior when applicable
* Property-based and dynamic test generation for contract-heavy logic

Testing guidelines:

* Prefer `Gen` + `check`/`checkN` for invariants; add shrinking-friendly generators.
* Use `TestClock`/`Live` with `adjust` or `sleep` instead of real time; assert schedules.
* Keep test layers minimal (`ZLayer.succeed`/`fromZIO`) and tear down resources with `Scope`.
* For streams, assert chunk safety with varied chunk sizes (`ZStream.fromChunks` and `transduce`).

---

# 8. Naming Conventions

* **Effects:** verbs → `loadUser`, `processOrder`
* **Services:** nouns → `UserRepo`, `OrderService`
* **Layers:** adjectives → `live`, `test`, `mock`
* **Errors:** domain names → `InvalidUserId`, `NetworkTimeout`

---

# 9. Forbidden Anti-Patterns

Agent must prevent or correct these:

❌ `var`
❌ shared mutable state
❌ blocking (`Thread.sleep`, `Await.result`)
❌ exception throwing for domain errors
❌ silent swallowing of errors
❌ layers created inside runtime logic
❌ side effects in constructors
❌ using `Throwable` as error type
❌ printing from business code
❌ mixing Future and ZIO without conversion

---

# 10. Preferred Patterns (Examples)

## 10.1 Retry with Backoff

```scala
effect.retry(
  Schedule.exponential(100.millis) && Schedule.recurs(5)
)
```

## 10.2 Hedged Requests

```scala
effect.race(effect.delay(p50))
```

## 10.3 Circuit Breaker

```scala
breaker(effect)
```

## 10.4 Graceful Shutdown

```scala
ZIO.addFinalizer(fiber.interrupt *> cleanup)
```

## 10.5 Service Pattern Snapshot

```scala
trait FooService:
  def doThing(in: Input): IO[FooError, Output]

object FooService:
  val live: ZLayer[FooClient, Nothing, FooService] =
    ZLayer.fromFunction(FooServiceLive.apply)

  def doThing(in: Input): IO[FooError, Output] =
    ZIO.serviceWithZIO[FooService](_.doThing(in))
```

## 10.6 Typed Error Design

* Prefer sealed ADTs or `enum` for domain errors; use union types when the set is small and explicit.
* Represent unexpected errors explicitly (e.g., `case class Unexpected(cause: Throwable)`) and map throwables at the edge.
* Keep error hierarchies purposeful; avoid stringly-typed errors or generic `Throwable` leaks.

## 10.7 Stream & Chunk Practices

* Use `ZStream.acquireRelease` for resourceful streams; close resources deterministically.
* Favor chunk-aware processing (`mapChunksZIO`, `ZPipeline`) to reduce per-element overhead.
* Validate chunk safety with different chunk sizes; avoid assumptions about singleton chunks.
* Keep stream effects typed; prefer `mapZIO`/`mapZIOPar` with explicit error channels.

## 10.8 Functional Design Patterns

* Keep algebras minimal and composable; push interpretation to wiring layers.
* Use `provideSomeLayer`/`provideLayer` to narrow environments instead of widening dependencies.
* Combine schedules for retries/backoff, add timeouts or hedging when talking to external systems.

---

# 11. Output Rules for Agent

When generating code:

* Use idiomatic Scala 3 syntax
* Provide necessary imports
* Use `case class` & `enum` for domain modeling
* Use type annotations when clarity requires it
* Use significant indentation when helpful
* Structure modules cleanly (services, layers, models, errors)

When explaining:

* Be concise
* Point out anti-patterns
* Justify technical decisions

When refactoring:

* Improve type safety
* Improve purity
* Push effects to edges
* Adopt proper ZLayer wiring
* Replace exceptions with typed errors

---

# 12. Validation Before Every Agent Output

Before responding, Agent must validate:

* [ ] Effects use correct `R`, `E`, `A` types
* [ ] Errors are domain ADTs
* [ ] No side effects escape ZIO constructors
* [ ] No blocking except within `attemptBlocking`
* [ ] Dependencies are injected via ZLayer
* [ ] Error handling is explicit and typed
* [ ] Resource lifecycle is guaranteed
* [ ] Parallelism uses safe ZIO combinators
* [ ] Code follows idiomatic Scala 3 style
